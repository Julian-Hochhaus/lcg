**LCG** LEEDCAMERAGUI: 
This GUI allows the user to control a SPECS ErLEED digital controller as well as a CCD-camera from The Imaging Source. 
This allows the user to record LEED images at specified kinetic energies as well as recording series of LEED images, e.g. for I(V) analysis.

This software is work in progress!
